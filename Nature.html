    <p><mark>Nature is the living tapestry that surrounds us, weaving together forests, rivers, mountains, and skies
            into a
            harmonious whole. It provides shelter, food, and beauty, reminding us of the delicate balance that sustains
            D life. From
            the gentle rustle of leaves to the powerful roar of oceans, nature speaks in countless voices, urging us to
            pause and
            appreciate its wonders. It is both fragile and resilient, a source of inspiration and peace, and a reminder
            of our
            responsibility to protect and cherish the world we call home.</mark></p>
